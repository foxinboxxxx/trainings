 This pattern is used to make one API look like another one that has different methods and signatures. The purpose here is to present client code with an abstract API to program against rather than a number of different APIs that have similar goals

•	Converts interface of a class
•	Into another that clients expect
•	Lets classes work together
•	Can provide additional functionality
•	Two types of adapters
-	Class adapters: Inheritance
-	Object adapters: Composition
•	Favor composition over inheritance
Also known as wrapper pattern
