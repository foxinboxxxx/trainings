Problems solved:
1. too many parameters
2. exposing attributes to client
3. encapsulated the attributes
4. enforced assembly order
5. separated assembly from components


separates 'how' from 'what'
assembly separate from components
encapsulates what varies
permits different representation
client creates director object
director uses concrete builder
builder adds parts to the product
client receives the product from builder
